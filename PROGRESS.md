# Progress

**Last updated:** 2026-08-29
**Chapters complete:** 3 of 121
**Next chapter to build:** **00-04 · Prediction, explanation, and cause**
(`notebooks/00_orientation/00-04_prediction_vs_cause.ipynb`) - the chapter that closes module 00.

A chapter counts as complete only when the learner notebook **and** its solutions notebook
have both been executed from a fresh kernel with no errors, and the chapter quality gate in
the course brief has been checked.

## Validation

Run from the repository root:

```bash
.venv/bin/python scripts/validate_notebooks.py
```

Last full run: 2026-08-29, **6/6 passed** (three chapters and their three solutions
notebooks). The notebook template also executes cleanly.

## Status by module

| Module | Chapters | Complete | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 00 Orientation | 4 | 3 | 00-01, 00-02, 00-03 done and validated; split per D-13 |
| 01 Python bridge | 6 | 0 | optional module, gated by its own diagnostic |
| 02 Data literacy | 8 | 0 | 02-08 needs the Seoul bike file, or falls back to synthetic |
| 03 Math foundations | 8 | 0 | |
| 04 Workflow | 8 | 0 | the spine of the course |
| 05 Regression | 12 | 0 | |
| 06 Classification | 12 | 0 | |
| 07 Evaluation | 7 | 0 | |
| 08 Unsupervised | 8 | 0 | |
| 09 Time series | 9 | 0 | needs statsmodels from 09-06 |
| 10 Neural networks | 12 | 0 | needs PyTorch (CPU) from 10-05 |
| 11 Applied domains | 7 | 0 | |
| 12 Other paradigms | 7 | 0 | |
| 13 Responsible & production | 8 | 0 | |
| 14 Capstones | 5 | 0 | |

Assessments: 0 written. One is due at the end of each module from 02 onwards.

## Environment

Python 3.11.14 in `./.venv`. Verified working: numpy 2.2.6, pandas 3.0.5, scikit-learn 1.9.0,
matplotlib 3.11.1, nbclient/nbconvert for validation. See `DECISIONS.md` D-01.

## Open items

- **Seoul bike dataset is not downloaded.** `scripts/get_seoul_bike.py` exists and is not run
  automatically. Until it is run, nothing in the repo asserts any of its column names,
  statistics or results, and `data/README.md` marks its schema as expected-but-unverified.
  Needed by 02-08; chapters before that do not touch it.
- **statsmodels and torch are not installed yet.** They are listed as commented lines in
  `requirements.txt` and should be installed when modules 09 and 10 are reached, so that a
  beginner is not asked to install a deep learning framework in week one.

## Log

**2026-08-29 (3)** - Chapter 00-03 (kinds of learning + the lifecycle map) and its solutions
built and validated. Failure lab: k-means asked for 2, 3, 4 and 5 groups on the same 60 days,
all four convincing - clusters are a partition you requested, not a discovery. Solutions E6
found that clustering on `rentals` alone matches the weather better (0.783) than clustering on
`temp_c` and `rentals` together (0.633), which makes the "which columns did you feed it" point
concretely. Curriculum split: the causality material moved out to a new chapter 00-04 (D-13), so
module 00 is now 4 chapters and the course is 121. Fixed two things found by executing: cluster
0 is the warm/busy group, not the cool one (prose corrected), and `np.float64(...)` leaking into
printed output.

**2026-08-29 (2)** - Chapter 00-02 (what ML is / when a rule wins) and its solutions built and
validated. Two contrasting demos: a known delivery policy where a written rule scores 1.000 and
the model can at best tie, and a lateness problem where the baseline scores 0.705, the best hand
rule 0.730 and a model 0.855. Failure lab: the policy threshold moves from 50 to 40 and the
stale model and stale rule fail identically (0.947) but cost very differently to repair. Fixed a
sklearn feature-names warning found by executing the solutions.

**2026-08-29 (1)** - Repository created. Curriculum (120 chapters, 15 modules), tracking files,
environment, notebook template, validation script and dataset documentation written. Chapter
00-01 and its solutions built, executed from a fresh kernel, critiqued against the quality
gate, and corrected (removed a stray printed return value; rewrote the diagnostics paragraph
to match the numbers the code actually produces; added a note about the count floor in the
synthetic generator).
